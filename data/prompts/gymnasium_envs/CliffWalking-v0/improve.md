You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with an incorrect code snippet from a Python program. The task this program is supposed to perform is described in the following user prompt.
Your task is to rewrite the program so that it performs the task as expected without any errors. You will be rewarded based on the number of test cases your code passes.

Cliff walking involves crossing a gridworld from start to goal while avoiding falling off a cliff.

## Description
The game starts with the player at location [3, 0] of the 4x12 grid world with the
goal located at [3, 11]. If the player reaches the goal the episode ends.

A cliff runs along [3, 1..10]. If the player moves to a cliff location it
returns to the start location.

The player makes moves until they reach the goal.

## Action Space
The action shape is `(1,)` in the range `{0, 3}` indicating
which direction to move the player.

- 0: Move up
- 1: Move right
- 2: Move down
- 3: Move left

## Observation Space
There are 3 x 12 + 1 possible states. The player cannot be at the cliff, nor at
the goal as the latter results in the end of the episode. What remains are all
the positions of the first 3 rows plus the bottom-left cell.

The observation is a value representing the player's current position as
current_row * nrows + current_col (where both the row and col start at 0).

For example, the stating position can be calculated as follows: 3 * 12 + 0 = 36.

The observation is returned as an `int()`.

## Starting State
The episode starts with the player in state `[36]` (location [3, 0]).

## Reward
Each time step incurs -1 reward, unless the player stepped into the cliff,
which incurs -100 reward.

## Episode End
The episode terminates when the player enters state `[47]` (location [3, 11]).

## Class Definition
The class should be called "Environment". It should have at least:

- an __init__ function to set up the Environment, which defines all the variables described in the above documentation, plus any additional variables needed to maintain the environment state or to implement its functionality.
- a set_state function to set a custom value for the environment and its internal representation (you can assume that when "set_state" is used, the task is not done and internal variables should be set as a consequence). set_state takes a single argument as input: a state observation from the observation space defined above.
- a step function to predict a step in the environment. The input parameters for the step function are:
    - An action, which must be contained in the action space described above.
  
    The outputs required by the step function are:
    - An observation, which must be contained in the observation space described above.
    - The reward for taking the action, as described in the reward definition above.
    - A boolean variable indicating if the episode is done.

## Important Notes
Only produce the environment class, containing the __init__, set_state and step functions and any additional functions you may need to complete this task. Do not write an example of how to use the class or anything else.
Be careful about edge cases.
Make sure to write all the required functions and that they have the exact names as specified in the task description. Missing or incorrectly named functions will not pass the tests and will result in a score of 0.
It is of VITAL importance that you do not leave undefined any function, but implement each of them completely.

First, write an explanation of the difference between the ground-truth transition and the step function's outputs in the example provided.
Second, point out the part of the code responsible for the incorrect prediction and why its logic is erroneous.
Third, suggest a concrete, actionable fix for it. 
Finally, fix the program in its entirety following the suggestion. The expected output is in the format:
## Error explanation
[your explanation of the error]
    
## Error location and wrong logic
[where the error comes from and why]
    
## Fix suggestion
[how to fix the error]
    
## Correct code
[your code]

## Incorrect code
You are provided with the following code snippet to fix.
```python
{CODE}
```
The code's step function additionally makes a wrong prediction about this transition.
## Step function inputs
{TRANSITION_INPUTS}
    
## Ground-truth transition
{GT_PREDICTION}
    
## Step function's incorrect outputs
{PREDICTION}
